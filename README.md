## üöÄ How It Works

### Video Detection
VIBRARY uses two methods to detect videos:
1. **Media Session API** - Captures metadata like title, artist, and thumbnail from sites that support it
2. **Direct video element detection** - Falls back to page title and captures thumbnails directly for other sites

### Duplicate Prevention
- Videos are identified by their page URL
- If you watch the same video within 30 seconds, it won't create a duplicate
- If the title changed (e.g., you edited it), the existing entry is updated

### Thumbnail Capture
- Automatically captures video frames while you watch
- Stores up to 10 thumbnails per video for preview on hover
- Works on sites that allow cross-origin access to video content
- Continues capturing when tab is active (pauses when minimized)

### Storage System
VIBRARY uses a dual storage system:
- **History Storage** (`historyVideos`) - All watched videos
- **Library Storage** (`libraryVideos`) - Only videos added to playlists

This ensures playlist videos are never accidentally deleted during cleanup.

### Data Structure
Each video entry contains:
```javascript
{
  id: "vid_timestamp_randomstring",
  title: "Video Title",
  url: "https://example.com/watch?v=123",
  website: "Example",
  favicon: "https://example.com/favicon.ico",
  thumbnail: "data:image/jpeg;base64,...",
  thumbnailCollection: [
    { time: 15.5, thumbnail: "data:image/jpeg;base64,..." },
    // ... more frames
  ],
  watchedAt: 1234567890,
  rating: 0, // 0-5 stars
  artist: "Channel Name", // if available
  album: "Playlist Name"  // if available
}
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Configuration

### Auto-Cleanup
- Set in Settings ‚Üí Auto-Cleanup
- Options: Off, 1 day, 7 days, 30 days, 90 days, 365 days
- Only removes videos from history that aren't in any playlist
- Runs hourly when enabled

### Blacklist
- Add domains to prevent tracking (one per line)
- Supports subdomains (e.g., `example.com` blocks `sub.example.com`)
- Toggle on/off without losing your list

### Export/Import
- Export creates a JSON backup of all data
- Import merges with existing data (won't overwrite)
- Supports migration from older VIBRARY versions

---

## üîí Privacy & Security

### Local Storage Only
- All data stored in `chrome.storage.local`
- Nothing sent to external servers
- No analytics or telemetry

### Permissions Used
- `storage` - Save your video library
- `unlimitedStorage` - Store thumbnails without limits
- `activeTab` - Detect videos on current tab
- `scripting` - Inject video detection script
- `<all_urls>` - Work on any video site

### Incognito Mode
- Works in incognito with extension allowed
- Data still saved locally (not tied to incognito session)

---

## üí° Tips & Tricks

### Keyboard Shortcuts
- Click video title to open in new tab
- Click thumbnail to open video directly

### Managing Large Libraries
- Use search to filter by title or website
- Sort by date (recent first) or rating
- Filter by star rating or unrated videos

### Thumbnail Quality
- Some sites block thumbnail capture (CORS policy)
- Thumbnail capture works best on sites you're logged into
- Preview shows multiple frames captured during viewing

### URL Handling
- Always saves the page URL, not the video file URL
- Handles YouTube, Vimeo, Dailymotion, and most video sites
- Works with embedded videos that use Media Session API

---

## üêõ Known Limitations

1. **Thumbnail capture** may not work on all sites due to CORS restrictions
2. **Background tabs** pause thumbnail capture to save resources
3. **Some sites** may show generic thumbnails if they block canvas access
4. **Duplicate detection** is based on URL within 30 seconds
