## 🎯 Overview

**VIBRARY** (short for **Video Library**) is a lightweight browser extension for Chromium browsers like Chrome and Brave.

It lets you keep track of videos you watch, rate them, and organize them into playlists — all without using browser history, cookies, or platform accounts.

It works on **any site that supports Picture-in-Picture** or Chrome’s **Now Playing (Media Session)** feature.

---

## ✅ Features

- **Create playlists** across websites
- **Rate videos** and filter by rating
- **No sign-in required** — skip account creation
- **No reliance on cookies or browser history**
- **Works fully offline** — all data stays on your device
- **Clean dark popup UI**
- Built with **Manifest V3** for Chromium browsers
