## üéØ Overview

**VIBRARY** (short for **Video Library**) is a lightweight browser extension for Chromium browsers like Chrome and Brave.

It lets you keep track of videos you watch, rate them, and organize them into playlists ‚Äî all without using browser history, cookies, or platform accounts.

It works on **any site that supports Chrome's Media Session API** or has detectable video elements.

## üì¶ Installation

### From Release
1. Go to the [Releases page](https://github.com/AppHazard-Studios/VIBRARY/releases)
2. Download the latest `.zip`
3. In Chrome or Brave:
   - Visit `chrome://extensions/`
   - Enable **Developer Mode**
   - Click **Load unpacked** and select the unzipped folder

---

## üöÄ How It Works

### Video Detection
VIBRARY uses two methods to detect videos:
1. **Media Session API** - Captures metadata like title, artist, and thumbnail from sites that support it
2. **Direct video element detection** - Listens for playing video elements as a fallback

### Duplicate Prevention
- Videos are identified by their page URL
- If the title changed (e.g., you edited it), the existing entry is updated

### Thumbnail Capture
- Automatically captures video frames while you watch
- Stores up to 10 thumbnails per video for preview on hover
- Works on sites that allow cross-origin access to video content
- Continues capturing when tab is active (pauses when minimized)

### Storage System
VIBRARY uses a dual storage system:
- **History Storage** (`historyVideos`) - All watched videos
- **Library Storage** (`libraryVideos`) - Only videos added to playlists

This ensures playlist videos are never accidentally deleted during cleanup.

### Data Structure
Each video entry contains:
```javascript
{
  id: "vid_timestamp_randomstring",
  title: "Video Title",
  url: "https://example.com/watch?v=123",
  website: "Example",
  favicon: "https://example.com/favicon.ico",
  thumbnail: "data:image/jpeg;base64,...",
  thumbnailCollection: [
    { time: 15.5, thumbnail: "data:image/jpeg;base64,..." },
    // ... more frames
  ],
  watchedAt: 1234567890,
  rating: 0, // 0-5 stars
  artist: "Channel Name", // if available
  album: "Playlist Name"  // if available
}
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Configuration

### Auto-Cleanup
- Set in Settings ‚Üí Auto-Cleanup
- Options: Off, 1 day, 7 days, 30 days, 90 days, 365 days
- Only removes videos from history that aren't in any playlist
- Videos in playlists remain in both the playlist and library storage
- Runs hourly when enabled

### Blacklist
- Add domains to prevent tracking (one per line)
- Supports subdomains (e.g., `example.com` blocks `sub.example.com`)
- Toggle on/off without losing your list

### Export/Import
- Export creates a JSON backup of all data
- Import merges with existing data (won't overwrite)
- Supports migration from older VIBRARY versions

---

## üîí Privacy & Security

### Local Storage Only
- All data stored in `chrome.storage.local`
- Nothing sent to external servers
- No analytics or telemetry

### Permissions Used
- `storage` - Save your video library
- `unlimitedStorage` - Store thumbnails without limits
- `activeTab` - Detect videos on current tab
- `scripting` - Inject video detection script
- `<all_urls>` - Work on any video site

### Incognito Mode
- Works in incognito with extension allowed
- Data still saved locally (not tied to incognito session)
- Persists across browser restarts

---

## üí° Tips & Tricks

### Navigation
- Click video title or thumbnail to open in new tab
- Search by title or website name
- Sort by date (recent first) or rating
- Filter by star rating or unrated videos

### Managing Large Libraries
- Use search to filter by title or website
- Sort by date, rating, or website
- Filter by star rating or unrated videos

### Thumbnail Quality
- Some sites block thumbnail capture (CORS policy)
- Thumbnail capture may be limited on cross-origin videos
- Preview shows multiple frames captured during viewing

### URL Handling
- Always saves the page URL, not the video file URL
- Handles YouTube, Vimeo, and most video sites with Media Session support
- Works with embedded videos that use Media Session API

---

## üêõ Known Limitations

1. **Thumbnail capture** may not work on all sites due to CORS restrictions
2. **Background tabs** pause thumbnail capture to save resources
3. **Some sites** may show generic thumbnails if they block canvas access
